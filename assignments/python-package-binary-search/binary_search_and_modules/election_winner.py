## 6. Election Winner from a Vote List  *(Easy)*

=================================================
ELECTION WINNER
=================================================

Problem Statement:
You are given a LIST of votes. Each element
of the list is the name (a single character or
a string) of the candidate that received that
vote.

Write a Python program that finds the WINNER
(the candidate with the highest number of
votes) and prints:
   - the winner's name
   - the total votes the winner received

If TWO or more candidates have the same highest
count, print all of them as a sorted list of
winners (a TIE).

-------------------------------------------------
Input Example 1:
['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']

Output Example 1:
Votes: {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
Winner: a (3 votes)

-------------------------------------------------
Input Example 2:
['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'c']

Output Example 2:
Votes: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
Tie between: ['a', 'b'] (2 votes each)

-------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
For ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']:
   a -> 3 votes  (highest)
   b -> 1 vote
   c -> 1 vote
Winner is 'a' with 3 votes.

For the second example two candidates share
the top count of 2, so the result is a TIE
between 'a' and 'b'.
